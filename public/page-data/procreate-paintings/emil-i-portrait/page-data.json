There really weren’t any well designed pressure sensitive styli out there with a fine tip.

Unlike styli that have the fat rubber nibs — it doesn’t appear it will ever wear out. Plus it doesn’t smear grease all over the screen which is a big win in my book.</p>\n<p>After getting a taste at what pressure sensitive drawing with Procreate could be like, I just want to own the real thing — an <a href=\"/articles/ipad-pro/\">Apple Pencil and iPad Pro</a>.</p>\n<p>Time lapse video recorded within Procreate.</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.42857142857143%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; \" > <div class=\"embedVideo-container\"> <iframe data-src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fFX1CUO472U?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe lazyload\" style=\"border:0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> </div></p>\n<p><strong>Tools used:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Adobe-Creative-Connected-Precision-Stylus/dp/B00LNECVN6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;qid=1461688574&#x26;sr=8-1&#x26;keywords=adobe+ink&#x26;linkCode=ll1&#x26;tag=mademist-20&#x26;linkId=85c30649adf50e2ff0b9c753f6dfe2c9\">Adobe Ink stylus</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Air_2\">iPad Air 2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://procreate.art/\">Procreate</a></li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Portrait of Emil I. inspired by a photograph on Sktchy.

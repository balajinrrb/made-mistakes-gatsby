Does this mean my iPod is toast and there were more problems than just a bad battery? Most reports online indicate I’m getting a refurbished one, which often come looking and acting brand new.</p>\n<p>Mine is pretty old so would it be far fetched for them to send me a newer generation model? Maybe one with a color display? I doubt it… but I don’t really care what I get at this point. Just give me an iPod that has 40GB’s or more of hard drive space so I can enjoy some tunes in the car. I can’t stand the radio for much longer.</p>\n<p>Update. Wow a package from DHL was waiting for me when I got home from work today. Looks like the replaced just the battery because my iPod appears to be the same. Good. Tomorrow is the test to see if it lasts more than 5 seconds on a charge. Otherwise its a new 80GB iPod for me.</p>","excerpt":"Last week I finally got an iPod return kit for my busted 3G iPod and dropped it off at DHL.

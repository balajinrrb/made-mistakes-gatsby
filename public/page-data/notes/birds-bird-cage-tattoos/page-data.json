Wendy added a bunch of birds in flight, a cage, and a tree branch to mimic the design of her other arm. She’s in the process of healing now so it looks pretty scabby in a few spots. Will probably need some touch ups if the color falls out, but that shouldn’t be a problem since the same thing happened last time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/hair-pull-heart-tattoo-xl.jpg\" alt=\"Some ink splat filler on my forearm\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"these-arent-photoshop-brushes-shut-up\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#these-arent-photoshop-brushes-shut-up\" aria-label=\"these arent photoshop brushes shut up permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>These aren’t Photoshop brushes, shut up</h2>\n<p>I didn’t get much done… just some lines, ink splats, and squiggles to fill in the mess that is my left arm.

As a user of Palm OS smartphones (Treo 600, Treo 650, Centro), I’ve come to rely on a proven feature set.</p>\n<p>The experience of having a device that organizes your life, makes phone calls, and connects online — has remained unchanged. For the most part the Palm Pre meets or exceeds my expectations, with only a few minor back steps. After the break is a full rundown of my Palm Pre likes and dislikes (mostly software related), in no particular order.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/palm-pre-wallpaper.jpg\" alt=\"Palm Pre closed with my sweet wallpaper\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"palm-pre-positives\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#palm-pre-positives\" aria-label=\"palm pre positives permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Palm Pre positives</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Device feels great in your hands. <em>(Not sure where all the “it feels cheap” reviews came from.)</em></li>\n<li>Screen looks awesome!</li>\n<li>The UI is slick.</li>\n<li>webOS is responsive and allows <strong>true multitasking</strong>.</li>\n<li>Notifications are handled elegantly.</li>\n<li>Push Gmail. <em>(Emails hit my Palm Pre before my desktop — sweet!)</em></li>\n<li>Synergy and the way that it syncs with “the cloud.” <em>(ie: Google, Facebook, etc)</em></li>\n<li>Battery life. <em>(I can easily make it through a workday which is all I had hoped for)</em></li>\n<li>Removable battery.</li>\n<li>Physical keyboard. <em>(Yes it’s small, but coming from a Centro I have no problems banging out txts or emails.)</em></li>\n<li>Plugging in via USB let’s you access the ringtone and wallpaper folders, to add your own to the device.</li>\n<li>Is capable of syncing with iTunes to add music, podcasts, videos, movies, or photos.</li>\n<li>Backups every day to your Palm Profile — in case you need to restore your device after a wipe.</li>\n<li>GPS and Sprint Navigation for turn by turn directions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"palm-pre-negatives\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#palm-pre-negatives\" aria-label=\"palm pre negatives permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Palm Pre negatives</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Having to pay $30 for the Classic app. Booooooooo!</li>\n<li>Having to use Classic at all!

Can’t say that I was excited about the thought of paying an extra $20 a month for the required Sprint Everything Data plan. But seeing how I’m getting more anytime minutes, Sprint Navigation, Sprint TV, and nights that start at 7pm instead of 9pm — I’ll live. My only real Palm Pre complaints stem from its software or lack of applications, which I’m pretty confident will be addressed with future firmware and software updates. I hope.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for a more in-depth look at the Palm Pre, check out <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100613121400/http://www.precentral.net/palm-pre-review\">Precentral’s extensive review</a>.

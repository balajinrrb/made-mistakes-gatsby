Next time I’m definitely paying extra for a hardcover with slip so pages are better protected. The only negative I’ve found with the printing is that some of my photographs printed a tad on the dark side. I didn’t bother calibrating my monitor or using any of Blurb’s supplied <a href=\"http://www.blurb.com/downloads/Blurb_ICC_Profile.icc\">ICC color profiles</a>, so that was probably the issue.</p>\n<p>They offer some guidance on <a href=\"http://www.blurb.com/color-management\">color management</a>, that I’ll look at more closely next time.

When iPad Pro senses Apple Pencil, the subsystem scans its signal at an astounding 240 times per second, giving it twice the data points it normally collects with your finger.

It just hasn’t been possible to do any sort of precise work because of hardware constraints and fat tips obscuring your view. Even with <a href=\"http://www.adonit.net/jot/touch/\">styli that promise improved accuracy</a> they’re still nowhere close to “real” pens and pencils.</p>\n<p>I’ve flirted with Wacom tablets for digital illustration work before but never fell in love with them. The accuracy was better than a mouse and keyboard, but not being able to draw directly on the screen just didn’t cut it. <a href=\"http://www.wacom.com/en-es/products/pen-displays\">Wacom’s pen displays</a> attempt to solve this problem but bring along their own set of quirks as well.</p>\n<p>I can’t really comment on parallax and air gaps in the screen, pen latency, or anything else for that matter since I’ve never used a Cintiq for drawing.

Love me some export options.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Starting out as a digital illustration virgin I wanted to ease in with something that felt familiar to the “real” tools I was used to. Paper by FiftyThree fit this criteria perfectly, making the transition from analog art to digital easier. I did experiment with Procreate at the same time, but was never really happy with the results since I didn’t understand the medium yet.</p>\n<figure class=\"two-column\">\n  <img alt=\"Wendy's portrait painted in Procreate with a Pogo Connect stylus\" data-src=\"../../images/wendy-rose-procreate.jpg\">\n  <img alt=\"Figure drawing experiments in Procreate\" src=\"../../images/grunge-figure-drawing-procreate-lg.jpg\">\n  <figcaption><p>My early attempts with Procreate weren't all that great.

Feeling the urge to try something more “professional” I’ve recently decided to dive deeper into the app. Partially to see what I could do with more capable tools and partially to prepare for what’s to come in November…</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/procreate-3-coming-soon.png\" alt=\"Procreate 3 features coming this holiday season\"></p>\n<p>Trading simplicity and minimalism for options and power felt extremely rewarding. Don’t get me wrong, Paper’s tools can’t be matched in a lot of ways. But they’re also seriously handicapped in an effort to keep the app simple and intuitive. Procreate on the other hand is built for one thing and one thing alone — art.</p>\n<p>It’s this single purpose that allows Procreate to excel at the sorts of things digital artists require in a workflow. In the five short hours I spent with the app I created a realistic portrait that probably would have taken me 10 hours in Paper. It almost felt like I was cheating by exploiting all of Procreate’s hallmark features this easily!</p>\n<figure class=\"two-column\">\n  <img alt=\"Layers in Procreate\" data-src=\"../../images/mr-allan-procreate-layers.jpg\">\n  <img alt=\"Blending modes in Procreate\" src=\"../../images/mr-allan-procreate-blending-modes.jpg\">\n  <figcaption><p>Layers, and blending modes, and time lapse recording, oh my!</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"time-lapse-recording\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#time-lapse-recording\" aria-label=\"time lapse recording permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Time lapse recording</h3>\n<p>Procreate did all the work capturing my strokes as I drew this portrait of “Mr. Allan” from a photo reference on <a href=\"https://get.sktchy.com/\"><strong>Sktchy</strong></a>.

Is that the sort of thing that will wear out like every other stylus I’ve owned? Hoping that answer is a big NO, but I guess we really won’t know for sure until later this autumn.</p>\n<p>After all this I still don’t know if I’m any closer to making a decision. iPad Pro and Apple Pencil on launch day this November? Or save my money, wait for someone else to be the guinea pig, and hope the technology makes it way down to smaller and cheaper form factors. Has everyone else decided if they’re getting them on launch day?</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p><a href=\"/mastering-paper/pencil-53-review/\">Pencil by FiftyThree</a>, <a href=\"/mastering-paper/pogo-connect-smart-pen/\">Pogo Connect</a> (for the nib alone since the original doesn’t play nice with my iPad Air 2), and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00575TN42/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;camp=1789&#x26;creative=390957&#x26;creativeASIN=B00575TN42&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;tag=mademist-20\">generics from Amazon</a>.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>The following Bluetooth styli are also pressure sensitive: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MNGIGMS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;camp=1789&#x26;creative=390957&#x26;creativeASIN=B00MNGIGMS&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;tag=mademist-20&#x26;linkId=3MSUXH5QRNRUSZBO\">Wacom Intuos Creative Stylus 2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LZW7RS0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;camp=1789&#x26;creative=390957&#x26;creativeASIN=B00LZW7RS0&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;tag=mademist-20&#x26;linkId=5NSEUCIDTRSDWORD\">Wacom Bamboo Stylus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LNECVN6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;camp=1789&#x26;creative=390957&#x26;creativeASIN=B00LNECVN6&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;tag=mademist-20&#x26;linkId=BYWPU37DS5KLIOVG\">Adobe Ink &#x26; Slide</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KFAG64O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;camp=1789&#x26;creative=390957&#x26;creativeASIN=B00KFAG64O&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;tag=mademist-20&#x26;linkId=2MWTP7IBZA6S3V5Y\">Adonit Jot Touch</a></p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-3\">\n<p>Wi-Fi 32GB model included with the purchase of Apple Pencil</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-4\">\n<p>Classic Pen included</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-4\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-5\">\n<p>64GB / Intel Core i3 / 4GB RAM model included with Surface Pen</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-5\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","excerpt":"Apple entering the stylus market means exciting things for iOS and the hardware running it.

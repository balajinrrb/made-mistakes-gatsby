I ended up with what I’m calling <strong>Skinny Bones</strong> by completely rewriting all of <a href=\"https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes\">Made Mistakes’s</a> stylesheets, <code class=\"language-text\">_layouts</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">_includes</code> to be more modular.</p>\n<p>I like to think of Skinny Bones as a starter for building your own Jekyll powered site — versus a theme you use as is. I’ve purposely kept the styling minimal and light to make adding your own flare and markup easier.

If pressed to pick a favorite, I would probably choose Graphite, just because it feels heavier and more solid to me. But there is something nostalgic and comforting about Walnut’s wooden texture that makes it a close second.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/pencil-53-walnut-graphite.jpg\" alt=\"Walnut and Graphite FiftyThree Pencil models side by side\"></p>\n<p>If you haven’t noticed, Pencil is flat like a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpenter_pencil\">carpenter pencil</a>, which keeps it from rolling about and getting lost<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>. Because of the wide and flat shape, I did find it uncomfortable to hold at first. Although after a few drawing sessions it wasn’t a concern as my hand adapted to the contour of Pencil.</p>\n<p>Between the two finishes, Walnut is lighter and softer to the touch with a wood texture allowing for more grip. Because of Graphite’s slick finish I occasionally had to readjust how I held it. When trying to fill in large continuous tones of watercolor I noticed it slipping the most. Slightly annoying sure, but not a deal breaker by any means.</p>\n<p>Similar to Paper, Pencil shares the same minimally designed aesthetic — that means no buttons, no battery indicator lights<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup>, and no on/off switches.</p>\n<p>I love how the UI in Paper doesn’t get in your way, and it’s refreshing that Pencil’s design echoes this theme. Common tasks like erasing or <a href=\"/mastering-paper/pencil-first-look/\">blending</a> become more natural, without the need to open the tool tray or press buttons.</p>\n<p>Want to erase something? Flip Pencil upside down and erase a mistake like you would “in real life.” Need to soften pencil strokes? Use your finger to smudge the pixels. </p>\n<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Pencil's battery charging in USB port\" data-src=\"../../images/pencil-53-usb-charging.jpg\">\n  <figcaption><p>So I lied.

It took some time but with the recent addition of <strong>Surface Pressure</strong> to Pencil + Paper, my desire to use a Pogo Connect has vanished.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/pencil-53-spare-parts.jpg\" alt=\"Close-up of Pencil’s tip and replacement packaging. Manual reads &#x22;SPARE PARTS.&#x22;\"></p>\n<p>The tip is responsive and as accurate as one can expect from the limitations the iPad’s digitizer imposes on stylus makers. Wedge shaped, offering a slightly finer point than the rubber nibs found on AluPens, Bamboos, and their capacitive tipped peers.</p>\n<p>Pencil’s tip does a great job of repelling any finger grease that may accumulate on the iPad’s screen — unlike some cheap styli that simply push it around obscuring your drawing.</p>\n<p>When Pencil by FiftyThree originally launched drawing with the broadside of the tip had zero affect on the marks you made. That all changed in iOS 8 and Paper 2.0.</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-the-tip-durable\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#is-the-tip-durable\" aria-label=\"is the tip durable permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Is the tip durable?</h3>\n<p>Pencil’s tip is by no means the most durable I’ve used. The longevity of the rubber that encases the 14kt gold plated tip is affected by the amount of pressure you apply and how held.</p>\n<p>Press hard as you draw or use the tip’s point more and you’re going to wear it out faster. I’ve had tips begin to show signs of tearing in under 5 hours and others last much longer.</p>\n<p>These numbers are relative to the user, which makes locking in a specific number hard. Using the longer side of the tip without a doubt prolongs its age. I suggest to use that whenever filling in larger areas of color</p>\n<p>Even if you do manage to tear through the rubber, the tips are still usable, albeit with some black streaking<sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup> across the screen.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">Replacement tips</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>The good news is FiftyThree now offers replacement tips and erasers <a href=\"http://shop.fiftythree.com/\">in their shop</a>.

Sure a ton of other <em>art</em> apps have smudging and blending tools, but they all break the creative flow in their implementations.</p>\n<p>FiftyThree has made this valuable tool fun and more true to <em>real</em> drawing by allowing you to switch between smudging and drawing in a fluid and natural way.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/pencil-53-blend-comparison.jpg\" alt=\"Blend speed comparison\"></p>\n<p>If you take the time to experiment with Blend I think you’ll <a href=\"http://making.fiftythree.com/the-precision-behind-blend/\">find it fairly sophisticated</a>. Moving your finger slowly allows the pixels beneath to be pulled and pushed around like finger-paints. Moving your finger fast over an area slightly blurs which I’ve found useful in creating <a href=\"/mastering-paper/pencil-first-look/\">depth of field effects</a> and simulating a bokeh.</p>\n<h3 id=\"constant-pressure-is-the-key\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#constant-pressure-is-the-key\" aria-label=\"constant pressure is the key permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Constant pressure is the key</h3>\n<p>If you’re soft with the amount of pressure you apply to the tip while drawing, Blend may trigger inadvertently.

For\nexample the pencil tool. If you were using a real pencil you’d press harder to\nmake a darker line. The same behavior occurs with a Pogo Connect, unlike 53’s\nPencil.</li>\n<li>Learning to use Surface Pressure in a controlled and fluid way can take some\npractice. Sure it’s easy to use the broadside of Pencil to fill in an area\nquickly. But if you want to create a line that varies from thin to thick, in\nan exact and smooth way you have to perform some crazy maneuvers with your\nhand by rotating Pencil’s tip from side to point. Some will argue that\npressing on the tip of a Pogo to do the same thing can be difficult, but I\nalways found it pretty easy to pull off compared to Pencil.</li>\n<li>Overall I think using Pencil and Surface Pressure together is a more enjoyable\nexperience than using a Pogo Connect. I’ve gotten sick of the constant\ndisconnects and manual restarts to get the stupid thing working with Paper.\nNeither styli is perfect in all circumstances.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At this point I wouldn’t bother wasting money on a Pogo because it has some\nserious problems with newer iPad’s since Apple changed the display technology\nbehind the screen.</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"9a51e8e0-c99a-50a0-88b8-208268c89451","frontmatter":{"name":"John S.","email":null,"friendlyDate":"January 15, 2015","iso8601Date":"2015-01-15T15:18:28.000Z","published":null},"html":"<p>I recently got a Pencil 53 for Christmas.

Through my informal tests I average\nabout 3 hours of drawing before a tip rips and starts to streak on the screen.\nWhen applying a lot of pressure I’ve gotten tips to rip in under an hour, and\nwhen barely touching the screen up to 9 hours. Even with the rubber ripping\nPencil is usable for much longer, it just starts leaving black residue on the\nscreen (easy to wipe off). And you can always use the other side of the tip\nuntil it rips there too.</p>\n<p>I think it really depends on your style of drawing and if you use the edge of\nPencil more than the tip. If more people were pissed over tips wearing out too\nquickly there would be more noise about it in the community. There those who\nhave told me they’ve had Pencil for up to a year and never replaced a tip. So\nthere’s that…</p>\n<p>And yes, Pencil is my main stylus. I went full time with it after I got a new\niPad Air 2 and Paper added Surface Pressure. Previously I only used a Pencil to\nturn on the Blend feature and did the bulk of my drawing with a Pogo Connect.\nBut after getting fed up with all the Pogo’s hardware and software problems I\nditched it.</p>\n<p>The only time I don’t use Pencil is when doing rough sketches or if I’m going to\ndo a lot of pencil/line-work. To save my Pencil tips I use a cheap dumb stylus\nfor my drawings until I’m ready for the control Surface Pressure enables.”</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"aa1061ea-8131-55d6-be5a-16e9a0203c31","frontmatter":{"name":"Ken","email":null,"friendlyDate":"January 25, 2015","iso8601Date":"2015-01-25T05:25:26.000Z","published":null},"html":"<p>For a teacher and classroom setting, would Pencil be a good tool for writing\nmath formulas and other hand written text?

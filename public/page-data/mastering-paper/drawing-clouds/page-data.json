One of the more important steps is choosing a blue to paint with. The hue…the saturation…and the brightness all play a role in the overall emotion of the piece. I tend to mix in a swirl of green and keep it slightly over saturated to contrast against skin tones as seen in my many <a href=\"/paperfaces/\">PaperFaces portraits</a>. If you’re going for doom and gloom, back off the blue and mix in gray instead to set the foundation for an overcast sky.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-blue-sky-mix.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of blue sky color mix\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-overcast-sky-mix.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of overcast sky color mix\"></p>\n<p>With the base sky color mixed, select the pencil tool and draw a line across the screen to represent the horizon.

What you’re trying to accomplish with this step is a smooth coat that gradually fades to white as you approach the horizon line. The easiest way to do this is with the watercolor brush, starting from the top of the composition, working down in a slight zig zag pattern.</p>\n<figure class=\"two-column\">\n  <img alt=\"screenshot showing sky stroke direction with arrows\" data-src=\"../../images/paper-53-sky-stroke-direction-arrows.jpg\">\n  <img alt=\"screenshot showing sky stroke direction desired result\" src=\"../../images/paper-53-sky-stroke-direction.jpg\">\n  <figcaption><p>Direction your stroke should follow. Back and forth, top to bottom.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>When painting, do not lift the stylus or your finger from the screen until you finish this first coat. The trick is to move very slow near the top, and progressively speed up the zig zag pattern as you approach the horizon line. Depending on how gradual of a fade you want in the sky, multiple coats may be required. Follow the same pattern from before to keep everything looking smooth.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-blue-sky-base-multiple.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of blue sky with multiple coats\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"painting-puffy-clouds\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#painting-puffy-clouds\" aria-label=\"painting puffy clouds permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Painting puffy clouds</h3>\n<p>Now comes my favorite part, painting happy clouds ala Bob Ross<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>. Sticking with the watercolor brush, we’re going to fluff a few clouds in using short circular strokes. If you have a <a href=\"/mastering-paper/pogo-connect-smart-pen/\">Pogo Connect Smart Pen</a>, you can control the amount of background lightening easier. But if you don’t, just focus on making quick strokes — the faster the better. </p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">ProTip: go easy on the white</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>White lightens quickly and you don’t want to remove too much blue at once, so be careful with this step. If you remove too much, just rewind and try again.</p></div></div>\n<p>The technique I use for fluffing in clouds with the brush is very similar to <a href=\"/mastering-paper/drawing-trees/\">how I create leaves</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-fluffed-white-clouds.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of fluffed clouds\"></p>\n<p>With the clouds shaped and looking like clumps of cotton, it’s time to add a few wispy cirrus clouds and clean the edges up. Again, a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2SXptNO\">Pogo Connect Smart Pen</a> comes in handy, allowing you to work lightly and gradually. Finger painters and normal stylus creators fear not, quick strokes can achieve the same results.</p>\n<p>No need to overdo it with the wisps, just a few light crosshatches is all that’s needed. For those longer streaky clouds your pencil strokes should be longer and more horizontal. I usually stick with just a pencil to create these wisp textures, but if you’re feeling adventurous a light touch of white watercolor can be used to finish them off.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-streaky-cloud-pattern.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of streaky cloud pattern\"></p>\n<p>Don’t be afraid to go back into the clouds with the blue color we initially painted the sky with. The same “streaky” pencil pattern used to draw wisps (see above) can be used to add subtle cloud shadows. I often flip flop between blue and white to get the detail just right.</p>\n<figure class=\"two-column\">\n  <img alt=\"screenshot adding blue shadows to clouds\" data-src=\"../../images/paper-53-cloud-blue-shadow-lg.jpg\">\n  <img alt=\"screenshot the finished cloud\" src=\"../../images/paper-53-clouds-lg.jpg\">\n  <figcaption><p>Adding subtle blue shadows to the larger fluffy clouds and the finished result.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"sunsets-and-fire-skies\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#sunsets-and-fire-skies\" aria-label=\"sunsets and fire skies permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Sunsets and fire skies</h2>\n<p>To paint a sunset, I use the same exact techniques and process. The only difference is the addition of three to four colors to create all the sunset fades and multi-colored clouds.</p>\n<p>Fiery red skies and silhouetted foreground subjects look super dramatic, so that’s what I’m going to demonstrate in the following steps. Remember, color is extremely subjective, I’m merely showing a few examples to get you started. Feel free to experiment and vary them up — there is no right or wrong here.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-sunset-red-color-mix.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of sunset red orange color mix\"></p>\n<p>We’ll start by mixing orange into red and then draw a light line at the sky’s horizon to act as our guide. Select the watercolor brush and apply paint from the horizon line up — in the opposite direction from before. Remember the zig zag pattern we used earlier to paint a blue sky? Good. Because it’s going to come in handy here.</p>\n<p>Just like the blue sky from before, paint slowly from left to right, slightly overlapping the row before without lifting your pen or finger. As you approach the top of the sky move faster to fade the color into the background.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-sunset-red-color-wash.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of 1st red coat\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"gradations-of-color\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#gradations-of-color\" aria-label=\"gradations of color permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Gradations of color</h3>\n<p>A few coats to build up the sky into a smooth gradation of color may be necessary. What you’re looking for is a darker red at the horizon, that gradually fades into the background about halfway up from the top. I fade the red around halfway to leave room to fade a dark blue-violet down from the top in this next step.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-sunset-blue-color-mix.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of sunset dull blue color mix\"></p>\n<p>After you’re satisfied with the red coat, mix a dull and dark blue gray to paint the other half of the sunset. Use the same zig zag painting pattern, only this time start in the upper left corner and work your way down. As you approach the faded red, paint faster to fade into the background just before it, leaving about an inch of background between.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img alt=\"screenshot background color between blue and red\" data-src=\"../../images/paper-53-sunset-red-blue-washes.jpg\">\n  <figcaption><p>Don't be afraid to rewind and redo your gradations. I usually don't get the shape and fade right on the first try.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>You could leave the sunset washes as is and proceed to drawing clouds, but if you want to add even more drama to the sunset, apply a thin wash of yellow. I like to mix a creamy color like so:</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-yellow-cream-color-mix.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot sunset yellow cream color mix\"></p>\n<p>And paint a light coat over the red, background area in the middle, and gradually fade into the blue.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-sunset-yellow-cream-wash.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot sunset yellow cream wash\"> </p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">ProTip: speed matters</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>Paint faster as you approach the blue wash to avoid turning it into a green color.

You want a pink color that has just enough white in it to lighten while you paint — some trial and error may be necessary to get the mix right. Once you successfully mixed a pink, fluff in a few clouds using short circular strokes (same technique used in the blue sky).</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-sunset-pink-fluff-clouds.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of pink fluffed clouds\"></p>\n<p>Giving these clouds depth and dimension can be achieved by adding a little more red to the mix. You’re looking to add just enough to make the color translucent instead of opaque. A few strokes is all that’s needed when applying red tinted shadows to the clouds. </p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-sunset-red-clouds-wash.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot add red shadows to clouds\"></p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">ProTip: find the right mix</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>If you don’t add enough red to the color mix, the watercolor brush will lighten the cloud instead of darkening it.</p></div></div>\n<p>A pencil filled with a pinkish red is also perfect for refining clouds edges or drawing in long wispy clouds.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-sunset-red-cloud-mix.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot sunset red cloud shadow color mix\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-sunset-pink-wispy-clouds.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot pink wispy clouds\"></p>\n<p>An added benefit of painting a sunset, is how it reacts with objects that are placed in silhouette. You can draw or paint almost anything and fill it with a dark color to add drama to your creation. The outline of a figure in the foreground, hills and mountain tops, or a half circle at the horizon to represent an eclipsed sun are all appropriate choices.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-sunset-finished.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of sun and hills in silhouette\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"variations-on-a-theme\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#variations-on-a-theme\" aria-label=\"variations on a theme permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Variations on a theme</h2>\n<p>Using all of these techniques I was able to create a variety of backdrops for the portraits in my <a href=\"/paperfaces/\">PaperFaces Project</a>.

To make these off-white lines more visible, we need to fill in the background with a contrasting color. In this example I went with a gray, but you can choose whatever color you want (we’ll delete it later so don’t agonize over the perfect color selection).</p>\n<p>To fill in the background, simply drag a swatch from one of your palettes (or the <a href=\"/mastering-paper/introduction-tool-guide/#color-mixer\">Color Mixer</a>) onto the canvas. When done correctly it should fill in the entire background leaving you with something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-filled-gray-background.jpg\" alt=\"dragging a color to the background to fill it\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"sketching-with-white\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#sketching-with-white\" aria-label=\"sketching with white permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Sketching with white</h2>\n<p>Now the fun begins!

I used a single color for my tracing but if you happen to change your color as you work it may be necessary to alter the background.

In a previous Mastering Paper tutorial I showed how <a href=\"/mastering-paper/grid-method/\">using grids</a> could help a beginner draw more accurately.

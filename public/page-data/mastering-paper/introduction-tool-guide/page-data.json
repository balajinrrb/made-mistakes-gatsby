This tool sets Paper apart from other apps by replicating the natural feel of pushing and pulling paint across a canvas. Without it I wouldn’t be able to shade, paint skies, or render hair realistically at all.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">ProTip: manipulate the brush’s size</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>While there is no obvious way to change the size of your brush in Paper by FiftyThree, you can make thinner lines when used with a pressure sensitive stylus like the Pogo Connect Smart Pen. Pressing lightly will make a line about a 1/4th as thick as the default one. <a href=\"/mastering-paper/pencil-53-review/\">FiftyThree’s Pencil</a> stylus also allows you to dynamically change brush size depending on how you hold it.</p></div></div>\n<p>It helps to think of your stylus tip as a brush loaded with watered down paint. Because the paint has been thinned it won’t be as intense or saturated as the color from one of the pens. Instead you need to build up color in multiple layers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-watercolor-even-fill.jpg\" alt=\"Choppy painting versus consistent painting watercolor swatches in Paper app\"></p>\n<p>This “thinned out” behavior also factors into how even of a coat you can apply. <em>Moving the brush faster</em> doesn’t let the paint fully cover a spot and will make it appear choppy. While <em>moving slowly</em> allows the paint to flow evenly off the brush and build into a dark even value. Mastering the speed at which you apply color is essential to creating even tones and shading.</p>\n<p>It may be helpful to create a few color scales with the primary colors, gray, and black to practice. Below are watercolor tests I created for myself after FiftyThree updated Paper to include the Color Mixer tool.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-watercolor-layers.jpg\" alt=\"Gradations created with the watercolor brush\"></p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">ProTip: white to lighten</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>When loaded with white the watercolor brush can become a way to lighten areas you’ve painted or drawn.

By mixing these colors directly on canvas you could make other colors.

Mixing together any color will almost always make a new one that looks great.</p>\n<p>For those who need more control or want a traditional color picker — one can be accessed by dragging a color swatch onto the mixing wheel, then tapping on it. From here you can adjust a color’s hue, saturation, and brightness (luminosity).</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-color-picker-slider.jpg\" alt=\"Color picker sliders screenshot\"></p>\n<p>For a good shadow color, I adjust the base color I’m shading with by cranking the <em>saturation down</em> and the <em>brightness up</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">ProTip: point of no return</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>If you go too far in any direction you will approach pure white, which will make the watercolor brush or marker opaque.

The first couple of months I used Paper by 53, I hated the Rewind feature because I couldn’t use it consistently. It pissed me off so much, that I gave up and used the eraser instead. I would have killed for a software button that triggered an undo back then…</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-rewind-stormtrooper.jpg\" alt=\"Rewind screenshot\"></p>\n<p>I eventually came to my senses and gave it another go by forcing myself to use Rewind exclusively. After a few drawings I mastered it and was time traveling back through my boo boos with ease.</p>\n<p>It’s entirely possible that FiftyThree tweaked Rewind behind the scenes to make it easier to use, but I like to think it was my perseverance that made the difference.</p>\n<p>Stick with it if you’re having trouble, I promise it will eventually come naturally. And if it doesn’t, you can always purchase a <a href=\"/mastering-paper/pogo-connect-smart-pen/\">Pogo Connect Smart Pen</a> and map the button to undo. To correct simple one step mistakes the undo button works great, for anything else I prefer the rewind gesture to avoid pressing the button a million times.</p>\n<h3 id=\"zoom\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#zoom\" aria-label=\"zoom permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Zoom</h3>\n<p>The single most requested feature by fans and haters of Paper… Zoom. I’ve drawn a hundreds portraits fine without zoom, but boy was I happy when FiftyThree finally added the feature.</p>\n<p>That said I did cheat a bit by using an accessibility feature in iOS<sup id=\"fnref-4\"><a href=\"#fn-4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup> that lets you magnify the screen by tapping with 3 fingers. Not a true zoom, but it does have its place when you need to magnify an area — the tools don’t scale so it isn’t that useful if you’re trying to vary line widths.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-zoom-tool-eye.jpg\" alt=\"Zoom tool screenshot\"></p>\n<p>There isn’t much else to Zoom — I’m merely mentioning it to increase awareness around it. Unlike other drawing and painting apps with zoom, the entire canvas doesn’t scale. Instead you control the area you want magnified by you opening a circular <s>portal</s> loupe that can be moved around or dismissed by tapping outside of it.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">Full screen zoom and grid indicator</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>The loupe shown above has been retired and replaced with a more traditional zoom tool in Paper v3.

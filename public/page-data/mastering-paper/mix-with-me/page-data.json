Ha!</p>\n<p>With the release of <a href=\"http://mix.fiftythree.com\">Mix</a> today, FiftyThree is making nuts like me very happy. I can now easily:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flip through a never ending stream of inspiration.</li>\n<li>Save said inspiration to my local journals.</li>\n<li>Learn from other creators by examining their original works in the medium they were created in.</li>\n<li>Share what I’ve learned as <em>starter</em> sketches, tutorials, and guides to be remixed on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re one of the lucky Paper creators to get an invite to Mix (or soon will be) feel free to join me in the Mix. If you’ve followed my <a href=\"/mastering-paper/\">Mastering Paper by 53</a> series of tutorials or <a href=\"/paperfaces/\">PaperFaces portraits</a> then you’ll probably enjoy what I’m sharing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mix.fiftythree.com/11098-Michael-Rose/42082\"><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-mix-faces.jpg\" alt=\"How to draw a face\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mix.fiftythree.com/11098-Michael-Rose/35882\"><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-mix-mountain.jpg\" alt=\"How to draw a mountainscape\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mix.fiftythree.com/11098-Michael-Rose/42074\"><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-mix-twins.jpg\" alt=\"The twins illustrated\"></a></p>\n<p>Easiest way to follow me is by <a href=\"https://mix.fiftythree.com/11098-Michael-Rose\">visiting my Mix profile</a> and clicking on the <strong>i</strong> icon.

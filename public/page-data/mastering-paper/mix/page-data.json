That’s not to say it can’t be used in other ways, but one gets the feeling from the six categories Mix is divided into (<a href=\"#types-of-mixes\">see below</a>) that is its primary purpose.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">ProTip: encourage feedback and discussion</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>To get the most value out of Mix I recommend posting “ideas” that encourage participation (share templates, purposely leave sketches unfinished, leave blanks, ask questions, etc.)</p></div></div>\n<p>Mix isn’t just for those who doodle and sketch. By following one of the curated categories or influential Mixers, it becomes a great tool for inspiration collection (think Pinterest or similar social bookmarking apps). For those who may fear a blank page or enjoy hoarding ideas for a rainy day, Mix has you covered with a never ending supply of ideas to remix.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/mix-53-star-button.jpg\" alt=\"Star button in Mix\"></p>\n<p>Each idea shared to Mix can be “favorited” by tapping the star button below it. Starred ideas, sketches, templates or doodles are grouped in a journal named Stars that works like any other journal you create in Paper (move, duplicate, share, and delete pages).</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/mix-53-stars-journal.jpg\" alt=\"Stars journal in Paper\"></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"types-of-mixes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#types-of-mixes\" aria-label=\"types of mixes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Types of mixes</h2>\n<p>As I hinted at before there are six Mix categories (<a href=\"#learning\"><strong>Learn</strong></a>, <a href=\"#sketching\"><strong>Sketch</strong></a>, <a href=\"#playing\"><strong>Play</strong></a>, <a href=\"#writing\"><strong>Write</strong></a>, <a href=\"#designing\"><strong>Design</strong></a>, and <a href=\"#thinking\"><strong>Think</strong></a>) that are curated by the FiftyThree team. If your creative juices are running on empty, looking for inspiration here is a great place to get inspired.</p>\n<p>Within the app you can find them by swiping down from the top edge of the screen while in the Mix. On the web they’re arranged across the top of the screen and can be scrolled through horizontally.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/mix-53-categories.jpg\" alt=\"Mix categories\"></p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">ProTip: follow curated categories</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>You can follow any or all of these categories to keep your stream fresh with ideas.

Most of the little tricks, gestures, and various techniques I’ve learned were uncovered through exploration (and sometimes by mistake). As a seasoned user of Paper I find this act of discovery somewhat magical, but to those who are new to the app I can see how it could be frustrating. This is where Mix comes in to play…</p>\n<h3 id=\"asking-for-help\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#asking-for-help\" aria-label=\"asking for help permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Asking for help</h3>\n<p>Leveraging the collaborative power of Mix is an excellent way to learn from others. When flipping through your stream you may come across a sketch that pulls off an effect you like. One way to learn how it was created is to open the page, write a note asking “how did you do this?”, and post it back to Mix. The original creator will be notified of your remix (if they have notifications turned on) and can respond to your inquiry directly with another Mix.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/mix-53-hair-girl-question.jpg\" alt=\"hair girl sketch on Mix with feedback drawn on it\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"tutorials\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#tutorials\" aria-label=\"tutorials permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Tutorials</h3>\n<p>With the prevalence of GitHub and open source methodologies, being able to “view source” on Mixes and examine them in the medium they were created is very useful. Especially for someone like me who sometimes finds it hard to ask for help and would rather figure it out on his own.</p>\n<p>I’ve been known to <a href=\"/mastering-paper/\">write up lengthy tutorials</a> explaining how to achieve specific effects and techniques with Paper’s tools. Mix affords me the option to supplement these written tutorials with bit-sized “cheat sheets” I can share with a wider audience. The feedback I get back is much more useful too. All I have to do is look at the remixes on an idea to see how they’re being interpreted and if they’ve been of use to anyone.</p>\n<p><strong>Practice Blending techniques with these two mixes:</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/mix-53-interstellar-blend-practice.jpg\" alt=\"Insterstellar Blend practice on Mix\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/mix-53-aurora-borealis-blend-practice.jpg\" alt=\"Aurora Borealis Blend practice on Mix\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"some-other-great-uses-for-mix-that-fit-in-with-the-learning-theme\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#some-other-great-uses-for-mix-that-fit-in-with-the-learning-theme\" aria-label=\"some other great uses for mix that fit in with the learning theme permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Some other great uses for Mix that fit in with the “Learning” theme:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Create or find templates to build off of. </li>\n<li>Use as a framework to jump start your creativity. </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchnotes\">Sketchnoting</a> and collaborative note taking during conferences to help visualize concepts and keep a record of what was discussed.</li>\n<li>Post word, math, science related problems for your students to work on and promote discussion by flipping through their remixes.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"sketching\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#sketching\" aria-label=\"sketching permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Sketching</h2>\n<p>I don’t have any numbers to back this up, but my gut tells me doodles and sketches are the most popular types of ideas being posted to Mix. At first glance the Sketch category could be mistaken as a self promotion dumping ground, but it’s actually something much more useful.</p>\n<p>The best finds here are those that are partially completed: rough line drawings, the start of a beautiful landscape, or a half painted figure waiting for you to give it a face. That’s not to say finished works of art don’t have their place on Mix — they do, but the heart of Mix is leaving a few doors open for others to close.</p>\n<p>My approach to sketching on Paper has been to add “behind the scenes footage” whenever possible. Whether recording <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaLqP2ipMLc6UugVLyTwWTiFtmmZzj7ao\">time lapse videos</a> to show how I draw or by sharing in-process screenshots on social media. With Mix there’s now a clean and seamless way of exposing a drawing’s evolution directly in Paper.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/mix-53-draw-a-cat-1.jpg\" alt=\"Draw a cat tutorial on Mix\"></p>\n<p><strong>Draw a Cat.</strong> An example of how to show process and teach at the same time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/mix-53-draw-a-cat-2.jpg\" alt=\"Draw a cat tutorial on Mix\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/mix-53-draw-a-cat-3.jpg\" alt=\"Draw a cat tutorial on Mix\"></p>\n<p>It may not be obvious at first but remixing yourself is a great way to chain together a series of sketches to show a progression.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">ProTip: share works in progress</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>Sharing often as you work on an idea is a great way of saving its history. Of course you can still duplicate pages as a means of backup, but remixing often removes some of the local clutter from your journals. It also encourages others to remix your unfinished ideas as they have more opportunity to build off of than the “finished” mix.</p></div></div>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"playing\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#playing\" aria-label=\"playing permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Playing</h2>\n<p>There’s so much quality work circulating on Mix that it’s easy to feel intimidated by it. I don’t mind admitting that I’ve felt inadequate quite a few times flipping through my stream and being blown away by what others are doing with Paper. I suppose that’s why I rarely remix other’s work out of fear of ruining what they’ve done.</p>\n<p>If this sounds like you, fear not! There’s a whole chunk of Mix dedicated to keeping things light and airy. Poke around the Play category and you’ll see what I mean.

Prior to Mix the burden was on me to create “frames” and templates I might need for wireframes and prototypes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/mix-53-design-iphone-hand.jpg\" alt=\"iPhone template on Mix\"></p>\n<p>Mix gives designers looking for a place to iterate and refine ideas an assortment of starter templates that can be used for all sorts of things.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Developing a mobile app or website? Download one of Mixes many blank templates.</li>\n<li>Remodeling or looking for decorating ideas? Remix floor plans and architectural renderings.</li>\n<li>Remix your own garments (clothing and accessories) using one of the templates shared by fashion lovers and designers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of the design work I do isn’t something that can be openly discussed or shown. Because of that I avoid sharing any confidential or sensitive sketches and work to Mix. But that’s not to say I won’t favorite and share back templates that I find useful to help others jump start a project.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"thinking\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#thinking\" aria-label=\"thinking permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Thinking</h2>\n<p>The Think category on Mix features ideas that encourage thought and conversation. I’m mostly a “one man show” and don’t have a lot of experience using Paper in group settings, but here’s a few ways I think Mix can help foster conversation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/mix-53-think-category.jpg\" alt=\"Think category on Mix\"></p>\n<p>White boarding and team brainstorm sessions can be made more interactive and fun by adding Mix to the… umm… mix. A nice feature in Paper that has gotten little attention is <strong>Presentation Mode</strong>. With an AppleTV and Presentation Mode enabled, the toolbar becomes hidden turning the projected screen into a digital white board.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Enable Presentation Mode under Settings\" data-src=\"../../images/paper-53-presentation-mode.jpg\">\n  <figcaption><p>Presentation Mode can be enabled in the iPad's Settings app, under <strong>Paper > Presentation Mode</strong>.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>By designating a facilitator to “drive” the projected iPad, the other participates are available to freely remix and collaborate on their own device(s). As discussions occur the facilitator can bounce between the team’s mixes and add notes in real time.</p>\n<p>Because Mix runs in “the cloud” remote team members have the ability to contribute and follow along as well.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"additional-resources\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#additional-resources\" aria-label=\"additional resources permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Additional resources</h2>\n<p>I hope this article has inspired you to check out Mix and become a part of the great community of Paper creators.

Three years\nago, we launched the Public Stream (previously known as Mix) as a place for\nusers to share and remix Paper creations. It was born out of idealism and\ncuriosity, a wish to open up creativity and share Paper creations around the\nglobe. While sharing sparked tremendous creativity, a relatively small number\nof Paper creators continue to use the Public Stream today. Many creators find\na larger, more engaged audience by sharing publicly on\n<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/madewithpaper/\">Instagram</a>,\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&#x26;vertical=default&#x26;q=%23madewithpaper&#x26;src=typd\">Twitter</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/madewithpaper\">Tumblr</a> and elsewhere. Since the\nsocial web has proven to be better place to share your work with the world, we\nhave decided to shut down the Public Stream and focus on the core Paper\nexperience.</p>\n<p>Be sure to save ideas posted only to the Public Stream before August 15th if\nyou want to keep them. Ideas in Paper grids other than the Public Stream will\nremain on your device.</p>\n<p>Starting today, we encourage you to share your Paper creations on your\npreferred social network using the #MadeWithPaper hashtag. We will be\nlaunching a website soon that showcases Paper creations from popular social\nnetworks.</p>\n<p>Shutting down the Public Stream will allow us to iterate faster on Paper and\nintroduce many exciting new features. A major update is planned for Paper\nlater this year that includes the return of Paper journals and other features.\nStay tuned for details in the coming months.</p>\n<p>We want to thank everyone who shared their creativity on Mix. In many ways,\nseeing your ideas has made us even stronger believers in our cause, to make\ncreativity more accessible.</p>\n<p>We hope to see you online.</p>\n<p>Georg Petschnigg Co-Founder and CEO, FiftyThree</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"../../../images/mix-shutdown-email.png\" alt=\"Mix shutdown email screenshot\"></p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/mastering-paper/pencil-53-review/","title":"Pencil by FiftyThree is still the best stylus for Paper","categories":["mastering-paper"],"tags":["Pencil by 53","Paper for iOS","Apple","review"]},"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/balajin/Workspace/made-mistakes-gatsby/src/posts/mastering-paper/pencil-53-review.md"},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/paperfaces/danya-w-portrait/","title":"Hooded Girl that Hides","categories":["paperfaces"],"tags":["portrait","illustration","Paper for iOS","Sktchy","black and white"]},"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/balajin/Workspace/made-mistakes-gatsby/src/posts/paperfaces/danya-w-portrait.md"}}}}

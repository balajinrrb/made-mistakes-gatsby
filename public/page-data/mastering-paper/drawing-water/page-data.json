I find this helps arrive at a better base color and contrasts nicely against a bright blue sky.

Just like painting skies, you’re trying for an even application of watercolor without lifting your stylus or finger off the iPad’s screen. Work your stroke from top to bottom, left to right, overlapping the previously painted portion slightly. A slow stroke with a slight zig zag to it will aid in painting an even and homogeneous tone quickly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-water-base-coat.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of water with a layer base coat\"></p>\n<p>Start with 2–3 even coats filling in the water with as smooth a tone as you can. Depending on how many wave troughs there will be, you may have to gradually fade the tone as you move down. The water I’m painting in this example is fairly flat, so keeping the tone smooth throughout is the goal here.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img alt=\"screenshot faded blue water with two coats\" data-src=\"../../images/paper-53-water-fade-reference.jpg\">\n  <figcaption><p>In the photo reference to the right you'll notice the water is darkest at the horizon and gradually fades down &mdash; that's the effect you're looking to replicate by increasing the speed of your stroke as you approach the bottom.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">ProTip: dark to light</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>Applying multiple coats adjacent to the horizon line and lightening as you work down will add dimension to the painting.

The technique is very similar to painting clouds using white, only in this case we’re using the same color we painted the water’s base with. The waves I’m painting are fairly flat so there’s no need to go overboard with the chop.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-wave-chop-dark.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of watercolor wave chop technique\"></p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">ProTip: use tints to lighten</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>If you go too dark, just mix white into your base coat color.

For larger waves with a lot of white foam, I like to paint a few more layers of blue anywhere these waves appear.

Select the pencil tool and fill it with the same blue we used to base coat the water. It doesn’t have to be an exact match if you didn’t save the color in your palette, just something close is all that’s needed.</p>\n<p>Starting at the top of the water lightly sketch strokes from left to right. The severity of each wave will determine the direction and angle of these pencil lines — the larger the wave, the greater the angle.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img alt=\"screenshot of wave lines using the base color\" data-src=\"../../images/paper-53-wave-lines-blue.jpg\">\n  <figcaption><p>Use a blue-gray base color to draw in the smaller wave shapes.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>A <a href=\"/mastering-paper/pogo-connect-smart-pen/\">Pogo Connect Smart Pen</a> works great for this step.

Apply the same technique used above but with this darker color instead of white. Focus on putting a few pencil strokes of dark adjacent to the white strokes which will add depth to the waves. As always, if you over work an area just rewind or draw over it using white if it’s a shadow, and a shadow color if it’s white.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-wave-shadow-mix.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of wave shadow color mixture\"></p>\n<p>A pencil mixed with a dark blue-gray is perfect for refining edges and adding definition to smaller waves.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-wave-shadows-zoom-lg.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of wave shadows drawn in pencil\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-wave-shadows-lg.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of wave shadows drawn in pencil\"></p>\n<p>Boom!

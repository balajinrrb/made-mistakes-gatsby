Using this replacement for a few days it was clear to me that something was different about this newer model.</p>\n<p>I use <strong>Paper by FiftyThree</strong> exclusively for drawing with the occasional <strong>Procreate</strong> experiment. When using either app I noticed that the sensitivity of the Pogo’s tip seemed off. To get the full range of stroke sizes I now had to press extremely hard to register a wide stroke (see screenshot below), which started to screw with how I draw.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/pogo-connect-sensitivity-lines.jpg\" alt=\"Calibrated Pogo Connect line comparison\"></p>\n<p>Isolating the cause is hard because so many factors had changed around the same time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple released iOS 7, a major rewrite and update to the iPad’s operating system.</li>\n<li>TenOne Design updated the Pogo Connect’s firmware to 1.1.0 — needed for some of the <a href=\"http://tenonedesign.com/connect.php\">new tips</a> they recently released.</li>\n<li>Design changes were made to the Pogo Connect to reinforce the internals and tip.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From my tests it seems to be related to the 1.1.0 firmware or the extra solder being used to keep the tip from busting off.

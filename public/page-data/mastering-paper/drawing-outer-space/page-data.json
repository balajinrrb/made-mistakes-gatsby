You don’t have to worry about being precise since it will only show on the lighten areas painted with white. Because we filled in the background with black earlier, any color that happens to bleed won’t be visible.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-space-blue-glaze-1.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of painting a blue glaze\"></p>\n<p>When glazing with the blue color, the same technique used when painting with white should be observed. Keep your strokes controlled and smooth. Move your finger slowly across the screen making sure not to <a href=\"/mastering-paper/watercolor-brush-update/\">lift it off the screen</a> for more than a second. Doing so will indicate to Paper that a new stroke was made and you will see a visible seam between the values.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-space-blue-glaze-2.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of darkening blue with layered watercolor strokes\"></p>\n<p>To create the illusions of depth, add more glaze layers towards the outsides of the shapes. This will aid in creating clusters of stars later by leaving bright pockets of light near the centers.</p>\n<p>Feel free to adjust the blue color’s darkness by moving the color sliders around. Don’t go too far with it though. Multiple layers of lights generally look better than a single dark layer.</p>\n<h4 id=\"fuchsia-glazes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#fuchsia-glazes\" aria-label=\"fuchsia glazes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Fuchsia glazes</h4>\n<p>Repeat the exact same process on the right half of the composition now, this time using a fuchsia or violet hue.

I like to start with a medium to dark color that is in the family of the area I’m placing them. Starting on the blue side first we’ll want to mix up a star color that is… bluish — what a shocker! Using Paper’s Color Picker makes things so much easier. Just sample a blue spot you painted earlier and then manipulate the sliders to get the intensity right.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-space-blue-stars.jpg\" alt=\"Mixing a medium-dark blue color to paint stars with\"></p>\n<p>Try to use your fingertip with a controlled tapping motion. If you strike the screen and drag your finger at all, a small streak will appear instead of a dot. If this happens use the <a href=\"https://wetransfer.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001333846-Canvas-Drawing-Tools#rewind\">Rewind gesture to undo</a> any mistakes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-space-blue-stars-finger.jpg\" alt=\"using a fingertip to create stars\"></p>\n<p>The more stars you add the more pronounced the effect. Varying the size of the stars and bumping up the brightness as you work helps as well. I strongly suggest using just the pencil tool and avoiding the pens and marker. The pencil is semi-transparent and in my opinion looks more natural than the others.</p>\n<p>Tapping in the same spot a few times is an effective way of brightening a star. Using your finger tip isn’t that accurate so it can take a few Rewinds to get the placement just right.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img alt=\"screenshot of zoomed pencil stars\" data-src=\"../../images/paper-53-space-bright-star.jpg\">\n  <figcaption><p>Increase the size or brightness of a star by placing more dots closing to each other.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>As before, when you move over to the fuchsia and violet half of the space scene, select matching star colors. Glazes can be applied to darken clusters of stars further adding to the realism — the same goes for using white to lighten. There really is no right or wrong way to approach it, so feel free to experiment and find what works best for you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-space-violet-star-glaze.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of stars glazed with violet watercolor\"></p>\n<p>Stars that may have gone too bright can be harmonized by painting over with matching watercolor glazes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"two-worlds\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#two-worlds\" aria-label=\"two worlds permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Two worlds</h3>\n<p>An outer space scene wouldn’t be complete without a planet or two, so let’s remedy that shall we?</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-space-planet-placement.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of planet placement\"></p>\n<p>The hardest part of world building is deciding where to place the planet(s).

Because I’m opting for something larger the “tap and hold dot trick” used in the first drawing won’t work this time — it caps out at around an inch in diameter.</p>\n<p>Since it’s pretty difficult to draw a perfect circle freehand I’m going to trace a cylinder. I just so happen to have part of a rotary cutter that is the size I need, so that’s what I’m using. The box that Pencil ships in is a good alternative if you don’t have anything else to trace.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-space-2-circle-trace.jpg\" alt=\"tracing around a rotary cutter with Pencil stylus\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-space-2-circle.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of a circle outline\"></p>\n<p>Placing the object directly on the iPad’s screen, carefully trace around its edge. It may be hard to match up the lines exactly on your first go so just Rewind to undo until you get it right.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">Update: perfect circles</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>Since writing this tutorial Paper was updated with <a href=\"http://www.fiftythree.com/think\"><strong>Think Kit</strong></a>. Now drawing perfect lines and shapes is only a swipe away in the tool tray.</p></div></div>\n<p>With the outline complete, use the watercolor brush with a white (or tint) to fill it in. It’s ok if your strokes bleed outside of the lines some, it adds to the glowing effect we’re trying to accomplish. Plus we’re going to lightly blend the edges anyways so any mistakes made now will be down played later.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-space-2-filled-circle.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of filled circle\"></p>\n<p>Next decide on what color you want your planet to be and begin painting over the white fill. For my scene I choose to paint with a dull red, being careful to stay within the lines as not to distort the circle’s shape too much.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-space-2-planet-color.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of painting a planet\"></p>\n<p>Using the same process as before, leave one of the planet’s edges exposed as you darken it. This will make it appear more three-dimensional as the tones are built up from light to dark.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-space-2-planet-shadow.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of painting a dark shadow across a planet\"></p>\n<p>I started to lose the shape of the circle because I was painting pretty fast. To correct it I darkened the lower left corner until it merged with the rest of the scene. Depending on what color the background is, these sorts of mistakes may be harder to cover-up.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">ProTip: use a stencil if you’re a messy painter</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>To help stay in the lines a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FPYQ14/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;camp=1789&#x26;creative=390957&#x26;creativeASIN=B000FPYQ14&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;tag=mademist-20&#x26;linkId=GLP5SABXVPYTF7PT\">stencil</a> can be used.

If you’re using Pencil and have blending enabled, there’s a new trick available to you.</p>\n<p>You may remember in the first part of this guide I cautioned against using the ink tools for making stars. Well if you blend ink dots with fast smudges they turn into glowing orbs. It’s a great effect that can add interest to the composition.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img alt=\"screenshot of blended stars\" data-src=\"../../images/paper-53-space-2-blended-stars.jpg\">\n  <figcaption><p>Swiping your finger quickly over a large white star will create a glow orb.

These both require you to have FiftyThree’s Pencil stylus and the Blend feature enabled.</p>\n<p>If you place strokes of colors on top of a dark background and then slowly smudge upwards, an effect that mimics the aurora borealis can be achieved.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img alt=\"a blended aurora in space\" data-src=\"../../images/paper-53-space-aurora-blend.jpg\">\n  <figcaption><p>Direction and speed really matter here. The slower you move the further the color can be <em>pulled</em></p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>A slightly modified approach to this technique can be used to create black holes.

My drawing style has evolved from the abstract to the more realistic since starting the <a href=\"/notes/paperfaces-ipad-portrait-project/\">PaperFaces</a> portrait project almost 2 years ago.

With regards to the face, you can roughly divide it into three sections.

One way of accentuating a color is by surrounding it with its complement.

If you move your finger (or stylus) slowly across the iPad’s screen, the mark will darken — moving fast, the mark will fade into the canvas and appear lighter. </p>\n<p>Speed is the single most important variable for creating smooth tones or glazes. The second is never lifting the tip off the screen until you’ve filled a shape.</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.42857142857143%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; \" > <div class=\"embedVideo-container\"> <iframe data-src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AjJVrFFaCck?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe lazyload\" style=\"border:0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> </div></p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">ProTip: smoothening out splotches of color</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>To even out stubborn light spots, keep rubbing until they turn dark.

I’d spend my time adding detail to the background elements instead of a person’s face just because they were easier for me.</p>\n<p>To paint in this style, start by lightly sketching out the figure to act as your guide. To simplify things I’m going to <em>pull a face</em> out of a bland background. I’ve found that it is much easier to drop in a background first, because you don’t have to be as precise. It also helps reduce hard edges or gaps in color that may appear around the face’s edge.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img alt=\"outline sketch of a face\" data-src=\"../../images/paper-53-faceless-sketch-lg.jpg\">\n  <figcaption><p>The color you choose to sketch with isn't super important, but a lighter one is much easier to cover-up.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>With your background dropped in, select the pencil tool, a light color, and sketch out the general outline of the figure. Drawing <a href=\"/mastering-paper/contour-drawing/\">sensitive lines</a> will convey more meaning in your drawing and guide how you paint. For example, I place heavier lines in my sketches to show shadows or areas I will want to darken with watercolor later.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">ProTip: skin color selection</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>When choosing a pencil color pick a flesh tone that is predominant in the face. This will make it easier to hide the lines later when you paint with white.</p></div></div>\n<p>With a rough sketch complete, it is time to put those skin tone palettes from before to work. For this example I’m going to choose the light red mix to start with. If you were to paint with this in its current state it wouldn’t be effective at <em>pulling the face</em> out of the background. What we need to do is mix white into it to make it opaque<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> and act like an eraser.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-faceless-red-mix-1-lg.jpg\" alt=\"red mix not lightening\"></p>\n<p>If you add just the right amount of white to a color it will allow you to lighten anything you paint over.

Take your time to carefully observe the shapes you are painting. Drawing is as much of seeing as it is putting a mark on the canvas.</p>\n<p>Don’t be afraid to <a href=\"/mastering-paper/introduction-tool-guide/#rewind\">Rewind</a> a stroke and redo it.

I found that this extra layer of texture added depth and complexity to the drawings which ultimately made them appear more realistic.</p>\n<p>Like before we start with a loose sketch of the subject to rough out our composition. The pencil’s color doesn’t matter too much, just make it something light and easy to cover up.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img alt=\"loose pencil sketch\" data-src=\"../../images/paper-53-face-pencil-sketch-lg.jpg\">\n  <figcaption><p>The face can be divided in half horizontally and vertically to help with placing features.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Depending on the orientation of the face these divisions may not be as obvious as a face viewed directly in front.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>To really capture an accurate likeness the placement of the eyes, nose, and mouth are very important. The use of lightly sketched guidelines across the face can help with their placement. While not true 100% of the time the width of the eyes can be used to accurately measure the distance between each of the face’s features.</p>\n<p><strong>Generally Speaking:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pupils are placed just above the center line.</li>\n<li>An average face is approximately five eyes wide.</li>\n<li>The bottom of the ears align with the bottom of the nose.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"refining-the-contours\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#refining-the-contours\" aria-label=\"refining the contours permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Refining the contours</h3>\n<p>Instead of switching to the brush, we’re going to stick with the pencil tool and begin refining the drawing. Color is going to play an important role in this step, if you’re not comfortable with that yet, I suggest working in black and white.</p>\n<p>Bouncing between the eraser and pencil tools, remove stray lines from the initial sketch and sharpen up lines. Build up tones as you work and avoid using black. Refer to the <a href=\"#choosing-colors\">face color guidelines</a> from earlier to help make smart color choices.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-face-erase-refine-lg.jpg\" alt=\"partially erasing guidelines\"></p>\n<p>To remove the guidelines I either partially erase them or lighten the sketch by blending it with my finger.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-face-erase-refine-blend-lg.jpg\" alt=\"blending guidelines away\"></p>\n<p>With the rough sketch cleaned up you want to begin darkening some contour lines. Start with the eyes first and focus your efforts on getting their shape as accurate as possible. A detailed eye will help draw the viewer in and can take emphasis off of the other features if you happen to screw them up.</p>\n<p>The basic idea here is to sketch in all the dark spots around the eyes, nose, and mouth. If you’re using my skin color palette from earlier you’ll want to select one of the darks in the second row. </p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-face-contour-refine-lg.jpg\" alt=\"refining facial features\"></p>\n<p>The areas you’ll want to focus on first are the pupils, upper eyelids, nostrils, and the crevices found around the lips.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-face-contour-refine-2-lg.jpg\" alt=\"refining facial features\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"shaping-skin-with-hatching\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#shaping-skin-with-hatching\" aria-label=\"shaping skin with hatching permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Shaping skin with hatching</h3>\n<p>Once you’ve finished darkening and refining contour lines you’ll want to begin shaping the skin. The primary way to do this is with <a href=\"/mastering-paper/basics/#parallel-hatching\">hatching techniques</a> and dry mixing colored pencils on the canvas.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img alt=\"hatching lightly around the eyes\" data-src=\"../../images/paper-53-face-hatching-lg.jpg\">\n  <figcaption><p>Starting with the eyes again, apply subtle shadows around them using the pencil tool. I use a Pogo Connect stylus to make even lighter strokes, but it can be pulled off without one.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>  \n<p>The idea is to build up tones from light to dark by overlapping pencil strokes and varying the distance between them. The amount of lines and the distance between them both effect how dark the tone will appear. I like to work from dark to light and use a combination of contour and cross-contour hatching to build up tones.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img alt=\"pencil stroke direction\" data-src=\"../../images/paper-53-face-contour-hatching-direction-lg.jpg\">\n  <figcaption><p>The red arrows indicate the pencil stroke directions I used to round the skin's shape.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>I’ve said this before in my <a href=\"/mastering-paper/basics/\">Back to Basics guide</a>, but it’s worth repeating. Be mindful of the direction of the strokes you are making when hatching to enhance the form. Observe how the skin bends and curves, and make pencil strokes that follow those same paths.</p>\n<p>Don’t feel the need to <em>shade</em> all surfaces! Focus your attention on the darkest values and build up those gradations first. Keep in mind that we will be covering these pencil strokes with watercolor so don’t go too dark. I suggest making your tones about 50% lighter than how they appear — you can always darken things up later.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">ProTip: up your game with a fancy pressure sensitive stylus</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>A Pogo Connect makes shading and using the pencil tool way easier. By varying the amount of pressure applied to the tip, you can make a darker line in a way that mimics a real pencil.</p></div></div>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-pogo-connect-pencil-line.jpg\" alt=\"pencil line\"></p>\n<p>To make the face appear more real you’ll want to use a wide range of colors. By applying washes of color pencil on top of each other, you can build up the skin in a more believable way. Don’t be afraid to dry mix blues and greens into pale oranges and tans.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img alt=\"dry mixing colored pencils\" data-src=\"../../images/paper-53-face-pencil-dry-mixing-lg.jpg\">\n  <figcaption><p>Washes of colored pencil can be blended into one another by lightly overlapping.

At this point you could call this a finished piece, but I’m going to take it a few steps further if you don’t mind.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">ProTip: one color at a time</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>Stick with one color and bounce around the face with it.

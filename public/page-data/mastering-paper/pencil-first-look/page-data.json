Being trained as a traditional artist, it works how one would expect, you draw with Pencil and smudge with your finger to blend.</p>\n<p>Sure a ton of other <em>art</em> applications have blurring and blending tools, but they all break the creative flow by forcing you open tool palettes or push buttons. FiftyThree has made this action fun and true to life by seamlessly enabling drawing and blending in a natural and intuitive way.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-blend-mountain.jpg\" alt=\"Mountain landscape painted with Paper, Pencil, and Blend\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-blend-mountain-reflection.jpg\" alt=\"Blended mountain reflection with Paper and Pencil\"></p>\n<p>Like all good things Blend is best used in moderation. I’ve found that it works great for blurring backgrounds to create a bokeh<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> like effect which in turn makes foreground subjects pop.</p>\n<p>Starting with a drawing I completed months ago, I was able to give it new life by running my finger over the watercolor painted background.</p>\n<figure class=\"two-column\">\n  <img alt=\"Paper painting of Wendy without Pencil and blending\" data-src=\"../../images/paper-53-wendy-forest-lg.jpg\">\n  <img alt=\"Paper painting of Wendy with bokeh background\" src=\"../../images/paper-53-wendy-forest-blend-lg.jpg\">\n  <figcaption><p>A little before and after for your eyeballs.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Portraiture is an area I’ve tried to focus on when creating with Paper. In my initial experiments I can see Blend playing a contributing role in my <a href=\"/paperfaces/\">PaperFaces project</a>. Until now it has been a challenge achieving realistic and smooth skin tones at the size that I draw — Blend changes all that.</p>\n<p>My favorite use of this new feature has been to create dreamy and surreal illustrations. This following piece is still a work in progress but I think it conveys a romantic quality that wouldn’t have been possible without Blend.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-girl-underwater-wip-lg.jpg\" alt=\"Work in progress blended drawing of a girl underwater\"></p>\n<p>The next couple of months should be fun.

I simply can’t get thinner watercolor\nstrokes without it. The fact that Pencil doesn’t have that could be a bummer,\nbut I think it more than makes up for it by being a stylus that is really\nresponsive, feels great, and adds features to Paper that other styli simply\ncan’t do.</p>\n<p>Lately I haven’t been too happy with my Pogo because of the tip problems. TenOne\nDesign’s customer service is really great, but I don’t think that should give\nthem a pass. And Apple screwing them by breaking compatibility with the iPad Air\ndoesn’t help.</p>\n<p>I think I’ll be able to live without pressure sensitivity once Pencil starts to\nmature in ways I’m sure FiftyThree is already planning for. With its current\nfeature set I think it’s designed more for the masses who wrestle with drawing\nand need features like palm rejection, or a dedicated eraser on the top. It’s\nnot really for us “advanced” folk who want the extra complexity of pressure\nsensitive strokes, which is why I think it wasn’t a focus this time around.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say pro users can’t get a lot out of Pencil. Blend is extremely\nnuanced and I think it’s going to be interesting to see where that goes once\nmore people get to play with it. I’m sure in the beginning there will be a ton\nof abusing the feature like the dreaded lens flare filter in Photoshop, but it\nreally does have promise. As does the eraser on top. I could see that gaining\nnew abilities by way of simple app updates.</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"4ffc3107-4a02-594d-8d45-c74a8f9089c1","frontmatter":{"name":"Lauren","email":null,"friendlyDate":"November 24, 2013","iso8601Date":"2013-11-24T02:31:54.000Z","published":null},"html":"<p>Loving the last illustration, can’t wait to see how it turns out!

To answer your question, yes you need to have a Pencil. I’m not\nsure if you’re seen the videos on FiftyThree’s website, but how it works is you\ntouch the tip of Pencil to an icon in the tool tray of Paper. After a few\nseconds it connects with it and then the extra stuff like palm rejection and\nblend.</p>\n<p>For blend to work you need Pencil connected. When it’s connected to Paper you\ncan only draw with it.

Once mastered you will have the skill needed to fade values into one another and model forms three dimensionally.</p>\n<p>A couple of points to keep in mind for creating an even tone.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Work in one direction moving parallel (example: up/down, left/right).</li>\n<li>Don’t be tempted to overwork and area — keep moving at a steady pace.</li>\n<li>If you are using a stylus with a sensitive tip (e.g. a Pogo Connect), don’t vary the amount of pressure you apply — keep it constant and light unless you’re trying to fade the tone.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-pencil-shading-samples.jpg\" alt=\"Pencil shading samples\"></p>\n<p>Once you’ve gotten the hang of producing a range of smooth values, it can be fun to introduce additional colors to the mix.

Stroke speed and pressure do little to modify the line quality which allows you to focus more on accuracy and placement. The <a href=\"/mastering-paper/introduction-tool-guide/#fountain-pen\">fountain pen</a> on the other hand can make drawing a line without weight fluctuations incredibly challenging — as shown below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-ink-tools-comparison.jpg\" alt=\"Comparing straight lines made with the ink tools\"></p>\n<p>By all means use whatever tool you’re most comfortable with. If you’re new to drawing on an iPad and just want to practice the following techniques, do yourself a solid and stick with the ink pen.</p>\n<p>There are many techniques for suggesting light and shadow when drawing with ink but they all follow the same general principle. <em>Draw marks</em> where there are shadows, and <em>leave the canvas blank</em> where there are highlights.</p>\n<h3 id=\"parallel-hatching\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#parallel-hatching\" aria-label=\"parallel hatching permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Parallel hatching</h3>\n<p>As the name implies, the lines you will be making should run parallel to each other. These lines can be vertical, horizontal, or at an angle — pick one and stick with it throughout the drawing. By drawing lines closer together they will appear to blend and create the illusion of being darker.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-parallel-ink-lines.jpg\" alt=\"Parallel hatching examples\"></p>\n<p>Another way to modify the overall tone created by these lines is to vary their thickness. This can be achieved by using the fountain pen and drawing thicker lines by pressing harder (if you use a Pogo Connect stylus) or making quick swipes (if you’re using a normal stylus or your finger).</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-parallel-ink-lines-vary.jpg\" alt=\"Parallel hatching varying line widths example\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"contour-hatching\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#contour-hatching\" aria-label=\"contour hatching permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Contour hatching</h3>\n<p>If you’re feeling confident and have honed your powers of observation by drawing <a href=\"/mastering-paper/contour-drawing/\">blind contours</a>, you should be all set for contour hatching. Instead of making straight marks like we did with parallel hatching, you will draw lines that follow the curved contours of your subject.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-ink-contour-hatching.jpg\" alt=\"Contour hatching examples\"></p>\n<p>Personally I don’t often have the patience required to create an accurate drawing using this technique.

It’s an effective way to quickly darken or <em>shade</em> a subject. I like to use the parallel hatching technique and build on that by crossing the lines at a slight angle. Contour lines can also be crossed for more life like results.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-ink-cross-hatching.jpg\" alt=\"Cross hatching examples\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"stippling\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#stippling\" aria-label=\"stippling permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Stippling</h3>\n<p>Instead of using lines to create tone and texture, you can use small marks. Much like the hatching techniques described above you vary the tone by increasing the density of these marks — the higher the concentration the darker it will appear.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-ink-stippling.jpg\" alt=\"Examples of stippling techniques\"></p>\n<p>The placement of these marks can be as expressive or mathematically as you want. I prefer to be free and loose, but don’t let that limit what feels right to you. Stippling marks can be anything you want — short ticks, dots, crosses, circles. And they can even be combined with hatching to add detail and enhance the effect.</p>\n<div class=\"custom-block notice\"><div class=\"custom-block-heading\">ProTip: hatching — not just for inking</div><div class=\"custom-block-body\"><p>Most of the ink techniques above can be adapted to the pencil tool and used to shade and create gradations of tone — specifically parallel, contour, and cross hatching.</p></div></div>\n<h3 id=\"ink-blobs-and-drips\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#ink-blobs-and-drips\" aria-label=\"ink blobs and drips permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Ink blobs and drips</h3>\n<p>Using both ink pens and the pencil you can simulate ink splatter, blobs, and dribs. The idea here is to recreate those happy accidents in a natural and random way. To start create a grouping of small circles and dots using the fountain pen.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-ink-blobs.jpg\" alt=\"Ink circles and a few dots\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-ink-blobs-irregular.jpg\" alt=\"Adding variation to the circles\"></p>\n<p>To make these shapes more irregular, zoom in and distort their shape by adding bumps and points along the edges. You don’t have to overdo this step — small variations here and there will do the trick.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-ink-blobs-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Adding detail to ink blobs\"></p>\n<p>Applying a few shadows and highlights with the pencil tool can make these shapes pop off the canvas. Draw a few dark strokes on one side of the blob, and then using a light color draw a highlight on the opposite side. Depending on how thick of a blob you are going for you may need to add a cast shadow using the pencil or watercolor brush filled with a light gray.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-ink-blobs-variation.jpg\" alt=\"Adding shadows and highlights to blobs\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"watercolor-brush-techniques\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#watercolor-brush-techniques\" aria-label=\"watercolor brush techniques permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Watercolor brush techniques</h2>\n<p>I’m going to go ahead and assume you’ve already read my <a href=\"/mastering-paper/introduction-tool-guide/#watercolor-brush\">Paper by 53 Introduction and Tool Guide</a>, where I explain how the brush works and some of its nuances.

Paint a <strong>continuous stroke</strong>, <strong>without lifting</strong> your finger or stylus. If you lift and dab an area multiple times it will darken and turn bumpy — don’t do that!</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-choppy-smooth-paint.jpg\" alt=\"A choppy painted shape versus one painted smoothly\"></p>\n<p>The other important variable to consider is moving your finger (or stylus) across the screen at a slow pace. If you rub in a circle motion on an area that is light it will eventually darken to its maximum point. As long as you <strong>don’t lift</strong> as you circle over these lighter spots, everything will even out.</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.42857142857143%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; \" > <div class=\"embedVideo-container\"> <iframe data-src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AjJVrFFaCck?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe lazyload\" style=\"border:0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> </div></p>\n<h3 id=\"feathering-edges\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#feathering-edges\" aria-label=\"feathering edges permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Feathering edges</h3>\n<p>Reliably producing a painted edge that is soft and blurry becomes important when blending shapes into each other.

They are most often used to pre-tone the canvas by removing white from it. The color(s) you choose can have a profound effect on digital pigments and strokes applied on top of them.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Red underpainting with green tree comparison\" data-src=\"../../images/paper-53-red-underpainting-foliage.jpg\">\n  <figcaption><p>Naked canvas on the left, pre-toned on the right to increase vibrancy.</p>\n</figure>\n<p>For example, contrasting colors can create some vibrancy in the scene. A lush landscape filled with a cool sky and green trees, pre-toned with a reddish glaze will cause the space around the leaves to shine through. Much more than if the canvas was left white.</p>\n<p>Or you can tone the canvas with the composition’s dominant color. When doing detail work you won’t have to worrying about covering up the bits of white canvas that show through. The background will roughly match what you are painting as your main subject, saving you precious time.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img alt=\"Blocking out shapes with watercolor\" data-src=\"../../images/paper-53-underpainting-value-shapes.jpg\">\n  <figcaption><p>Working out the shapes and values of a composition before adding detail.</p></figcaption>\n<p>An underpainting layer can also be used to establish the correct values and confirm the composition of your subject.

The results aren’t quite the same as if you were mixing oil paints on a real palette, but they get the job done. Here’s how to do it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select the two complementary colors you wish to mix and put one in the Color Mixer by dragging it over, and the other in one of your open palette slots.</li>\n<li>To neutralize them, do one full rotation of the Color Mixer with both complementary colors selected.</li>\n<li>Finally tap the color in the Mixer and slide the saturation (middle bar) down somewhere between 10–20% to dull it.</li>\n</ol>\n<figure class=\"three-column\">\n  <img alt=\"Mixing a neutral gray step 1\" data-src=\"../../images/paper-53-mixing-complementary-gray-1.jpg\">\n  <img alt=\"Mixing a neutral gray step 2\" src=\"../../images/paper-53-mixing-complementary-gray-2.jpg\">\n  <img alt=\"Mixing a neutral gray step 3\" src=\"../../images/paper-53-mixing-complementary-gray-3.jpg\">\n  <figcaption><p>Neutralizing complementary colors using the Color Mixer.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>I’ve found that instead of mixing grays from white and black, it is more pleasing to mix them from pairs of complementary colors.

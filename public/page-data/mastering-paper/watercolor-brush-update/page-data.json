This allows you to create some nice gradient effects to add depth and dimension to your sketches.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-watercolor-gradient.jpg\" alt=\"Purple gradient\"></p>\n<p>On the flip side, the brush can be difficult to control when trying to maintain a continuous tone (especially when painting large shapes). If your hand isn’t steady and you accidentally lift off the iPad’s screen, the next stroke will be a splotch that will stick out noticeably.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-choppy-smooth-paint-2.jpg\" alt=\"Choppy and smoothly painted shapes\"></p>\n<p>In Paper version 2.0, the watercolor brush is way more forgiving and lets you lift off the screen without ruining the “wet on wet” effect. Now if you’re quick you can start painting a shape, lift your finger/stylus, and then go back into the shape to continue working its contours. The days of having to paint a large shape perfectly in one stroke are over — hooray!</p>\n<p>To better visualize how the new brush works I shot a quick video that you can view below. As far as I can tell there is about a 1 second delay on how long you can lift off the screen before Paper decides to overlay the strokes.</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.42857142857143%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; \" > <div class=\"embedVideo-container\"> <iframe data-src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Lt1oIsH4wHo?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe lazyload\" style=\"border:0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> </div></p>\n<p>For those of you who have tried out the new watercolor brush, how’s it treating you?

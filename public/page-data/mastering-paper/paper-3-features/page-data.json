Every time I open Paper on my iPhone 5s I’m amazed that the features found on the iPad version all made the journey over.</p>\n<p>Much like the complete UI overhaul in <a href=\"http://news.fiftythree.com/post/79379441335/the-paper-ios-7-update-is-here-brighter-fresher\">version 1.6.1</a>, I got the sense that the team at FiftyThree re-evaluated every bit of the app for 3.0. Even if that meant modifying Paper’s defining characteristics<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> to make the experience more intuitive and fluid.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-3-store.jpg\" alt=\"Paper 3.0 App Store screenshot\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"importing-images\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#importing-images\" aria-label=\"importing images permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Importing images</h2>\n<p>Love it or hate it (stick me in the love it camp), you can finally import images into Paper by FiftyThree! Tap the camera icon and you can either snap a picture or choose one from your photo library to place on the canvas.</p>\n<p>You are limited to one photo per idea — but you can scale it, rotate it, and even call-out an area of interest with a new <a href=\"http://blog.fiftythree.com/posts/annotate-spotlight-photos\"><em>Spotlight option</em></a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-3-photo-import.jpg\" alt=\"Importing photos into Paper 3.0\"></p>\n<p>I’m excited to use this feature as a sketching aid — drawing directly on reference images I’ve imported into Paper.

Journals transitioning into “Spaces” is one of the best things to happen to Paper since the introduction of <a href=\"https://www.fiftythree.com/think\"><strong>Think Kit</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Instead of ideas bound together as books, they’re presented with a different UI metaphor — stacks of paper. These stacks expand into an aligned grid of cards you can interact with when tapped on.</p>\n<p>I’ll tell you this much, scrolling through ideas in this way sure beats flipping back 500 plus pages to find a drawing I worked on a year ago.</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.42857142857143%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; \" > <div class=\"embedVideo-container\"> <iframe data-src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VBMt_sjEXF4?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe lazyload\" style=\"border:0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div> </div></p>\n<p>These new “Spaces” are more accommodating of the new content types found in Paper 3.0 as well.

I personally like to organize my thousands of\nsketches into a few journals vs. hundreds of smaller journals.</p>\n<p>I accept that I’m not the norm since I seriously doubt the average Paper user\nhas as many sketches as I have. Being able to scroll throw a grid view to find\nsomething is way more usable to me then the old tedious way of flipping page by\npage. And even if I broke a journal of 100+ pages into several smaller ones you\nnow have the added problem of remembering what journal you stuck a sketch in.</p>\n<p>And that’s not even addressing the problems with the old journals and how they’d\noften accidentally flip to a new page when drawing near the canvas’ edge. Sure\nthe Moleskine look is gone but if you ask me that was a necessary change to make\nthe app usable on both iPad and iPhone.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day I care most about how the actual pens, pencil, and\nwatercolor tools function. None of that was messed with. Everything else is\neither icing on the cake or a distraction depending on your perspective. If you\ndon’t like the social stuff don’t use it, note taking and picture import…\ndon’t use it.</p>\n<p>I get why people are upset with the core stuff being changed or removed, but the\naddition of new tools and features? Not a big deal if you ask me.</p>\n<p>That’s a bummer on the Book printing feature being killed. I wrongly assumed it\nwas still available since there’s an option to “Print Book” when in journal\nview, but it just goes to a currently unavailable page. Not sure if that’s\npermanent or what.</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/procreate-paintings/jordan-s-portrait/","title":"Blushing my cheeks","categories":["procreate-paintings"],"tags":["Procreate","portrait","illustration","time lapse","Sktchy"]},"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/balajin/Workspace/made-mistakes-gatsby/src/posts/procreate-paintings/jordan-s-portrait.md"},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/procreate-paintings/jenell-d-portrait/","title":"Don't play with soot","categories":["procreate-paintings"],"tags":["Procreate","portrait","illustration","time lapse","Sktchy","black and white"]},"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/balajin/Workspace/made-mistakes-gatsby/src/posts/procreate-paintings/jenell-d-portrait.md"}}}}

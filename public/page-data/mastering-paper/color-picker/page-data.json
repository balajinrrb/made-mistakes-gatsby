You also have the option of refining a color by moving any of the three HSB<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> sliders around, but I’ll get to that in a minute.</p>\n<p>There’s not much more to using the Color Picker. As the small circle is moved around the canvas, the color inside of it will change letting you know what color is selected. There is also a black dot in the center to help with alignment when trying to pick up a tiny speck of color.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-color-picker.gif\" alt=\"animation of Color Picker changing colors\"></p>\n<p>When you’ve found a color you’d like to work with or save to your palette tap the circle.

But when sampling the transparent strokes made by the watercolor brush or blends, you may not get the results you were expecting.</p>\n<p>Let’s use these two splotches of color below as an example of what I mean. On the left is a shape painted with the watercolor brush and on the right one with the marker tool — both filled with the same color.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-sampled-colors-1.jpg\" alt=\"shapes filled with the same color\"></p>\n<p>Because of the transparent nature of the watercolor brush, the painted shape on the left appears to be a lighter hue than the one on the right. You’d think that when dragging the Color Picker over both shapes it would sample them as two different colors, but that’s not quite what happens…</p>\n<figure>\n  <img data-src=\"../../images/paper-53-sampled-colors-2.jpg\" alt=\"sampling shapes filled with the same color\">\n  <img src=\"../../images/paper-53-sampled-colors-3.jpg\" alt=\"sampling shapes filled with the same color\">\n  <figcaption><p>Notice anything strange? According to Paper both colors are identical even though they don't look the same. Weird. Filling the page with a dark color had no effect on sampling.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>As far as I can tell the Color Picker completely ignores the background page color when sampling — rather than combining the page color with the transparent strokes on top of it. I’m not entirely sure if this is by design, some sort of bug, a limitation of the software, or a little of both. Before crying foul, sampling the colors on a transparent background in Adobe Photoshop produced the same exact results. So the picker doesn’t seem to be broken…</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-sampled-colors-4.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of sampled colors in Photoshop\"></p>\n<p>This little gotcha is even more pronounced when sampling areas that have been heavily blended as shown below.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img data-src=\"../../images/paper-53-sampled-colors-5.jpg\" alt=\"sampling gradations\">\n  <figcaption><p>The discrepancy between what you see and what the picker samples is really noticeable here. I was expecting the bottom sample to be a lighter blue than what was actually picked up.</p></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Personally I think it would be less confusing if the Color Picker was sampling the combined color that you see on screen (page color + transparent strokes on top) like <strong>Procreate</strong> and other drawing apps. But like I said it’s more of an edge case scenario since you’ll mostly be sampling opaque and layered colors.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-share-colors\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-to-share-colors\" aria-label=\"how to share colors permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How to share colors</h2>\n<p>Don’t let that little color sampling inconsistency get you down, there’s still plenty to love about the Color Picker and enhanced Mixer tools. If it wasn’t clear from the sub-heading above, you can now <em>sort of</em> share colors and palettes with the Paper community. </p>\n<p>As I’ve started to work with the picker more I’m beginning to see value in including color swatches in the margins of my drawings. It’s a way of bringing clarity to the palette I use in a piece. Not only that, but it gives me a place to stash additional colors since my 6 palettes are more than filled up.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/paper-53-color-picker-swatches.jpg\" alt=\"example of color palette painting in the margin\"></p>\n<p>Aside from the new picker, the Mixer received some love by now including numeric values on each of the 3 sliders. These numbers map perfectly to HSB<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> values which makes communicating the exact makeup of a color others that much easier.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../images/photoshop-hsb.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot showing the HSB picker in Adobe Photoshop\"></p>\n<p>The HSB/HLS color models are available in most desktop graphics programs like Adobe’s Photoshop. By opting to include a standardized color model in Paper it is now possible to match colors across platforms and apps. As a designer I find this helpful for maintaining color consistency when importing Paper PNG files into Adobe Creative Suite documents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sharing-color-palettes-on-mix\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#sharing-color-palettes-on-mix\" aria-label=\"sharing color palettes on mix permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Sharing color palettes on Mix</h3>\n<p>When I wrote my Mastering Paper guide for <a href=\"/mastering-paper/drawing-faces/\">drawing portraits</a> there wasn’t a good way for me to share my palettes with the community.
